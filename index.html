				Visit of the Kalahari desert <br>
				</h1>
			</div>
			<p id="text">
				The Kalahari desert is an interesting desert, so I decided to visit 
				there. I arrived at Maum airport and got on the 4x4 I booked 
				that came with a driver guide. Before traveling much, I asked 
				him for some facts on the Kalahari desert. According to the 
				driver, the desert is 60 million years old and is also 4000 
				kilometers! I asked what type of desert the Kalahari is. The 
				Kalahari desert is a semi desert. Semi deserts are when parts of 
				the desert get the average water a desert should have (4.3-7.9 
				inches of water). While other parts get more water than a desert 
				should have (20 inches of water). I also searched up what the 
				meaning of Kalahari is and it means “the great thirst” in Tswana 
				and “a waterless place” in Kgalagadi. The first stop was near 
				some trees. I asked the driver why we stopped there and what <img src="leopard.jpg" id="leopard">
				kind of trees they were. He said the trees were sausage trees. He 
				also said that leopards were on top of those trees. When I 
				looked up, I saw a leopard laying on a branch. I asked him why 
				they do that. They lay on those trees because other animals get 
				attracted to those trees. So they just camp there to eat animals 
				that got baited. I asked him if there were any problems in the 
				Kalahari desert. He said that global warming is causing slow 
				growing trees and shrubs to get burned. Only to be replaced 
				with fast growing grass. He also said that global warming is 
				drying up water holes. Before we went to the hotel, it started to 
				rain. I thought it was one in a million that it rained there. 
				Though I thought maybe rain here is common. I asked him and 
				he said that the Kalahari sometimes gets rain or thunderstorms. <img src="flamingos.jpg" id="flamingos">
				Then I saw flamingos going for the water. He said that 
				flamingos go for shrimp in the water that has just been born. 
				He also said that zebras go for the water for their necessary 
				minerals from the water. When we were going to my hotel, I 
				saw some people drinking liquid from a plant. The driver 
				stopped and talked to the men. They were called the San 
				people. He translated their text and said they were thirsty. The 
				plant they were drinking from was called a bi bulb plant. The 
				San people have lived in the Kalahari desert for<img src="desert.jpg" id="desert">  60 million years! 
				San people are semi-nomadic meaning they travel wherever 
				there is water. They start fires by spinning a stick on top of 
				another stick. We were getting close to the hotel when the driver 
				said that sleeping for animals is dangerous. I knew that if they 
				slept, they would probably get eaten by predators but the dead 
				animal also attracts other animals. That is one reason why you 
				should not drop your food and not not pick it up. That was my 
				experience with the Kalahari desert. What are your thoughts on 
				the Kalahari desert?
